  "about_app_description": "There are a lot of better applications that broaden your vocabulary and increase your language skill. That app is not about that, it’s made for passing tests and exams. If you don’t want to broaden your vocabulary in some topic, you don’t want to learn some new words but you’d like to pass an exam from foreign language, that app is perfect for you. \n \nYou’d like to learn a specific set of words, no more, no less, just what teachers demand from you.\nWhy would you waste time repeating random words from “animals” when your teachers demand only cat, dog and fish to pass the exam. \n\nYou add words, you repeat, you pass, you chill.",
